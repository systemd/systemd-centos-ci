# Relatively simple script which updates Vagrant boxes used by systemd CentOS CI
# with build dependencies and other configuration, so we don't have to that in
# every CI job. These updated images are then stored on the CentOS CI artifact
# server and can be reused by other CI jobs.
# This script is intended to run in CentOS CI Jenkins periodically, to keep
# the images up-to-date.
#
# In time of writing this, the setup phase, which consists of updating the
# base system in the container and installing build/test dependencies, took
# around 10 minutes, which is pretty substantial time slice for a CI run, which
# takes ~45 minutes.
